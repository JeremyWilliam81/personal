# Hello, I'm Jeremy Wiersema

This is my personal project repository where I will be uploading projects I work on both in and out of class.
I’m focused on developing strong foundations in software engineering, backend systems, and application development.  
I enjoy solving problems, debugging complex issues, and building projects that turn ideas into working systems.

Currently improving my skills in:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Frontend Development
- System Design Principles
- Version Control & Collaboration
